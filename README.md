# Neurosity

This tablet web application is designed to allow a researcher to obtain data from study participants and store the raw data in a database and on AWS. The application allows for three different researcher roles: Super Admin, Site Admin and Researcher. Each researcher role has different access to data. The Super Admin can view data from all research groups and the Site Admin and Researchers can only view data from their own research group (site). Any researcher can initiate a session. Within each session the participant can take a survey and/or provide EEG data. Once the data collection is complete for the survey or EEG, the data is automatically uploaded to AWS and stored locally on the database. The participant is unable to see any data that is generated. Following data generation, the researcher can evaluate the data that was generated by visiting the dashboard. 

This application was presented on Facebook live and Zoom on 6/1/2021: https://www.facebook.com/share/v/ELwHqw6ba3Re2ZPM/
